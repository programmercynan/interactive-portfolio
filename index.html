        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> 👋 Hi there! I’m Cynan, a passionate coder by day and a snack connoisseur by night. When I’m not busy battling bugs, you can find me perfecting my coffee-making skills or trying (and failing) to keep my plants alive. 🌱
            I believe in code, creativity, and the power of a well-timed meme. My life’s mission? To create beautiful websites and make people laugh, one line of code at a time. If you need me, I’ll be somewhere between debugging and daydreaming about pizza. 🍕 </p>

                    <p>I once tried to teach my dog to code. Spoiler: He still prefers fetching sticks over fetching errors. 🐶</p>
